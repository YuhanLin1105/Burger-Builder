## Experience in Development
* [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) allows your to focus on writing react code and deploy it without lots of configeration at start.
* `shouldComponentUpdate` is written for all react components, which on the phone causes a significant performance improvement. For Large and medium-sized applications when facing performance problems, try writing your own  `shouldComponentUpdate` could help you a lot.
* `Stateless Functional Components`([Stateless Functional Components](https://medium.com/@joshblack/stateless-components-in-react-0-14-f9798f8b992d#.xjqnbfx4e)) has no lifecycle hooks.
* Dealing with State using React + Redux is very convenient, as long as init it where you need it.
